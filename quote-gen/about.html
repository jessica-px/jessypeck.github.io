            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>Built as front-end web development exercise, this is a random generator that makes sharable pictures of cat-related quotes. It uses Javascript
                to retrieve real quotes from Forismatic, a third party API, and it then replaces various words to make the quotes
                more cat-oriented. 
            </p>
            <p>Not every quote in the Forismatic database is suitable. Some of them are too long, and some of them are too difficult
                    to catify. So each quote is passed through several filtering functions, and if they are rejected, the process starts
                    over at the beginning. But the Forismatic API can only handle so many requests so quickly - to avoid overloading them,
                    I've implemented a short mandatory waiting period between each quote attempt. A loading widget communicates this waiting
                    period to the user.
            </p>
            <p>Once the quote is made, a random cat picture is selected from a JSON file. Each entry in this JSON file contains an image
                path, as well as styling information such as whether the text should be dark or light, and where the text can be oriented.
                With this information, the text and image are then combined via Javascript into an HTML canvas. A URL for the final image
                is derived from that canvas, and finally the image is displayed on the website.
            </p>
            <p>The intention of this project is to make <em>sharable</em> pictures with cat quotes, but without back-end work, that's easier
                said than done. Facebook sharing is formatted based on metadata that Facebook stores in its own servers. To share dynamicly created
                content would require server-side scripting to force Facebook to update its metadata on the fly. So for the time being,
                the Facebook "share" button woefully only shares a link to the homepage. Similarly, the Pinterest button is entirely non-functioning. 
            </p>
            <p>Using Javascript, I was able to allow the Twitter button to share the dynamically generated text quote, but because my dynamic
                images are not stored server-side, the tweets cannot include a url to the actual image. The "save" button, however, works exactly
                as planned, and downloads the finished image directly to the user's device.
